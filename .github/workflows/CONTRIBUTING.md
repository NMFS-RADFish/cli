# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project\! Contributions of all kinds are welcome, whether it’s bug reporting, feature requests, improving documentation, or submitting code. Before you get started, please take a moment to read through our contribution guidelines.

## 1\. Introduction

This project is driven by a community of developers, users, and contributors. We believe in open collaboration, and your input helps improve the project. Whether you're new to open-source or a seasoned contributor, we are excited to have you on board. Please follow the guidelines outlined below to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## 2\. Report Bugs

If you encounter any bugs, glitches, or unexpected behavior while using our software, we encourage you to report them.

### How to Report a Bug:

- Search through the [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NMFS-RADFish/projects/2/views/3) or the Issues Log for that respective repo to ensure the bug hasn’t already been reported.
- If it's a new bug, create a new issue using our **Bug Report Template**.
- Provide as much detail as possible, including the steps to reproduce the bug, the version of the software, and any error messages.

### Template Bug Report:

When reporting a bug, please use the following template to ensure we can diagnose and resolve the issue efficiently. Providing detailed and accurate information helps us to reproduce the problem and implement a fix faster.

#### Bug Description:

Provide a clear and concise description of the issue you're encountering. Focus on what the problem is, how it impacts functionality, and any observable symptoms (e.g., error messages or unexpected behavior). The more specific, the better.

_Example: "When I try to save a new entry in the form, I receive an error message that says 'Failed to save data,' and the form remains unsaved."_

#### Steps to Reproduce:

List the exact steps someone needs to follow in order to replicate the bug. Be as detailed as possible to ensure the bug can be consistently reproduced. This will help our team trace the issue.

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '...'
3. Scroll down to '...'
4. See error '...'

_Example:_

1. Go to the homepage.
2. Click on the "Submit" button in the top-right corner.
3. Fill in all form fields.
4. Click "Save" and see the error message: "Failed to save data."

#### Expected Behavior:

Describe what you expected to happen versus what actually happened. This helps us understand the intended functionality and where it is diverging.

_Example: "I expected the form to save successfully without showing an error message and for the new entry to appear in the list of entries."_

#### Screenshots:

If applicable, attach screenshots to help illustrate the problem. Highlighting the specific areas in the screenshots that demonstrate the issue is particularly useful.

_Example: A screenshot of the error message or the UI element that isn't functioning as expected_

#### System Info:

Provide details about the system you were using when you encountered the issue. Knowing your environment can help us identify compatibility problems or issues specific to certain setups.

- **Operating System**: \[e.g., Windows 11, macOS 13 Ventura\]
- **Browser/Environment**: \[e.g., Chrome v114, Firefox v106, Safari\]
- **Version of RADFish**: \[e.g., 1.0.0\] (If you’re not sure, you can usually find the version in the "About" section of the application.)

#### Additional Context:

Include any other relevant information about the issue. This could be recent changes made to your system, specific data that triggers the bug, network issues, or other background that may help diagnose the problem.

_Example: "This issue started occurring after I updated to the latest version of the software. Prior to the update, everything worked fine."_

## 3\. Documentation and Examples

Our documentation is an essential part of helping new users and contributors understand the project. If you notice missing, outdated, or unclear information in the documentation, please help us improve it.

### Help us Improve the Documentation:

- If you find a section that is unclear or incomplete, feel free to submit a pull request with your improvements.
- If you’re unsure how to improve the documentation, \[open an issue\](link to issues page) and describe what is missing or unclear.
- Examples and tutorials are especially valuable\! If you've used the project and created your own examples, we would love to add them to our examples library.

## 4\. Feature Requests

We value your input and welcome ideas that could improve our product\! To ensure your feature request gets the attention it deserves, please follow the steps below. Providing detailed information will help us assess, prioritize, and potentially implement your idea more efficiently.

- Search through the [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NMFS-RADFish/projects/2/views/3) or the Issues Log for that respective repo to ensure the feature hasn’t already been requested.
- If it's a new feature, create a new issue using our **Feature Request Template**.
- Provide as much detail as possible to describe the feature.

### Feature Request Template

#### Feature Description:

Provide a clear and concise description of the feature you're proposing. What should the feature do, and how would it benefit users? Try to frame it in terms of functionality rather than just a solution.

_Example: "Allow users to export reports in both PDF and Excel formats from the dashboard. This would make it easier to share and analyze data offline."_

#### Why is this Feature Important?

Explain the impact of the feature. Why is it valuable? Does it address a current limitation, streamline a process, or solve a specific problem? Make sure to convey how it improves the user experience or adds significant value to the project.

_Example: "Currently, users must manually copy and format data from the dashboard, which is time-consuming. Exporting reports in common formats like PDF and Excel would save users time and reduce errors."_

#### How Should this Feature Work?

Describe how you envision the feature working. This can be high-level or detailed, depending on your familiarity with the project. Include possible interactions, workflows, or any user interface elements you think should be part of the feature. This helps the team better understand the scope of your idea.

_Example: "Add an 'Export' button in the upper-right corner of the dashboard that allows users to choose between PDF or Excel formats. When selected, the data from the visible dashboard should be automatically converted and downloaded in the chosen format."_

#### Additional Context:

Provide any other relevant information that supports your request. This could include links to related documentation, screenshots, or references to similar features in other tools or products. Adding as much detail as possible will help us understand the request from different perspectives.

_Example: "See attached screenshots from a similar tool that allows for report exporting. This feature could be adapted to fit our platform's existing layout and style."_

By following this format, you help ensure that your feature request is clear, actionable, and easy for us to evaluate. Thank you for helping us make RADFish better for everyone\!

4. When your code changes are ready for review, open a pull request. Be sure to fill out all the applicable fields in the generated PR description.
5. Link your pull request to the related GitHub issue. This important step helps us know which issue this solution fixes. Tip: You can link your pull request to the related issue in the body of the pull request description by adding the text “Closes #[issue number]” or “Resolves #[issue number]”.
6. Submit your pull request against the develop branch.

If the pull request is accepted, we will schedule the issue and merge the pull request for you.
